<TextBlock 1 w:54 h:5>
Good day. 
I'm the village consultant.<Delay 20>
(But to tell you the truth,
the village chief knows far
more than I do...<New>
However, the chief is an
awfully busy person, so I
have been placed in charge
of answering some of the
more mundane questions.)<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 2 w:54 h:5>
As a special for this week,
we are lecturing on our
super-duper self-defense
techniques.<Delay 20> Wouldn't you
like to learn about them?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 3 w:56 h:1>
What can I do for you today?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 4 w:56 h:6>
<Opcode 1 255>    Explain battle commands
    Explain 'Defense' option
    Explain Action Points
    Explain 'Attack' option
    Explain 'Combo' option
    Nothing now, thanks<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:48 h:3>
Alright, then.
Allow me to explain the
overall battle commands.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 6 w:56 h:6>
During battle, there are two
groups (called 'Command
Rings') you can choose from.<Delay 20>
You can toggle between the
groups using the left and
right directional buttons.<New>
The first Command Ring
includes the most frequently
used 'Attack', 'Defense' and
'Chi' options.<New>
The second Command Ring
contains special commands
such as 'Combo', 'Escape'
and so forth.<New>
You fight by skillfully
selecting from the two
groups of options the
action that best suits
your circumstances.<New>
Normally, you should be
able to get by with just
the first group of options.<Delay 20>
The 'Item' option is in both
sets, so you don't have to
switch groups to use items.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:50 h:4>
...Well, that pretty much
wraps it up.<Delay 20> Please come
back again whenever you
need my services.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:52 h:3>
Oh I see, I see. You wish
to hear about defending?<Delay 20> 
Well allow me to begin...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:56 h:6>
By choosing 'Defense', you
can halve the damage your
opponent does to you.<Delay 20>
Fighting is not just about
being on the offensive <--> at
times it pays to hold back.<New>
When you find yourself in a
pinch, it may be a good idea
to leave the attacking up to
your other party members and
simply choose to defend
yourself from enemy attacks.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:50 h:5>
...Well, that's about it.<Delay 20>
Oh, and if you have any
other questions, please
feel free to stop by any
time now, you hear!?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 11 w:56 h:4>
Aha! I knew you were going
to ask me about them! <Delay 20>
Well then, allow me to
explain about Action Points.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:56 h:6>
There are three kinds of
attacks <--> Weak, Strong
and Fierce <--> each using
up a set amount of Action
Points when performed.<New>
When all your Action Points
are used up, your turn will
end. Conversely, as long as
you have Action Points left,
you may continue to attack.<New>
In other words, Action
Points represent how many
attacks you can perform in
one turn of combat.<New>
You will start out with only
3 Action Points. However,
as you increase in level,
your available Action Points
will increase accordingly.<New>
The secret to putting up a
good fight is the way you
spend your Action Points <-->
what strength of attacks
you use, and in what order
you dish them out...!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:46 h:4>
...Well, that's it in a
nutshell.<Delay 20> Oh, and don't
hesitate to ask if you
have any other queries!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 14 w:46 h:4>
My, you are bold!<Delay 20>
Okay then, allow me to
explain to you a little
about attacking.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 15 w:58 h:6>
I am sure that you already
know that there are three
types of attack <--> Weak,
Strong and Fierce <--> each of
which uses up a different
number of Action Points.<New>
The Fierce attack (<X> button)
uses up 3 points in a single
blow. Hence, if you have only
3 Action Points, all will be
used up by one Fierce attack.<New>
The Weak attack (<T> button)
will use up 1 point per blow.
So, with 3 Attack Points, you
can attack an enemy three
times in rapid succession.<New>
The Strong attack (<S> button)
uses up 2 points per blow.<Delay 20>
So, if you've got 3 Attack
Points, you can combine one
Strong attack with one Weak
attack to total 3 points.<New>
It is possible to keep
pressing the <X> button to try
obliterating enemies in one
Fierce blow, but you may find
that relying on this alone
presents difficulty later on.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 16 w:52 h:4>
...That's about all I have
to say about that, really.<Delay 20>
Please come by again when
you're in need of advice.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 17 w:52 h:5>
Ooooh! The 'Combo' option,
eh?<Delay 20> I didn't expect you to
ask about it! Well then,
allow me to explain the
art of the combo.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 18 w:56 h:6>
When you use the 'Attack'
option, there are times
when you do not use up
all your Action Points.<New>
Such is the case when
you eliminate an enemy
by using only a portion
of your total points, or
when you cancel midway
through an attack turn.<New>
Action Points that don't
get used are stored in an
'AP Counter'. When this AP
Counter stores up a certain
amount of points, you will
be able to use 'Combo'.<New>
A combo is a rapid series of
Deathblows let loose all in
one turn, and tends to be
rather ferocious.
Any foe on the receiving end
of a combo will likely die.<New>
At low experience levels,
you probably won't be able
to do much combo damage.<Delay 20>
But in time you will be able
to unleash devastating
combo attacks!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 19 w:38 h:4>
...And that's that!<Delay 20>
So, if you need any
other advice, you
know where I am!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 20 w:42 h:3>
I see. Well anyway...
feel free to ask me
anything, anytime!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 21 w:10 h:2>
Ahem!<Delay 10>
AHEM!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 22 w:50 h:4>
So as not to bother other
clients, please keep all
personal conversations
down to a minimum!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 23 w:50 h:5>
When it comes to fighting
techniques, I tend to be
extremely fussy!<Delay 20>
I've started to study up
on them recently...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 24 w:60 h:6>
How 'bout it then?
Wanna hear what I have to say?
<Opcode 1 255>    Explain Abilities
    Explain Deathblow Skills
    Explain Skill Levels
    Forget it!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 25 w:48 h:3>
Hmmm, you're pretty
studious for a young'un.
Good, now listen up!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 26 w:54 h:4>
That 'Guided Shot' ability
you already have is one of
the many mysterious powers
related to Ether and Chi.<New>
Not everyone has the
talent to use such powers.
People are each born with
different innate abilities.<New>
If an individual does
have the gift, increasing
in level will give rise
to more powerful abilities.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 27 w:38 h:2>
Hmm.<Delay 20> I see a lot of
potential in you.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 28 w:38 h:2>
Good, good.<Delay 20>
Ask away, young'un!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 29 w:60 h:6>
As you already know, there
are three strength levels for
the ordinary 'Attack' option:
Weak attack   (<T> button)
Strong attack (<S> button)
Fierce attack (<X> button)<New>
'Deathblow Skills' are special
chains of attacks that first
use some Weak or Strong blows
to knock your foe off balance
and then end with a Fierce
blow to do some major damage!<New>
But you must first master
the use of Weak, Strong and
Fierce attacks before you
will be able to learn such
Deathblow Skills.<New>
To master these attacks, you
should keep trying to do, say,
four Weak blows in a row, or
two Strong blows, or even a
Fierce blow followed up with
another type of blow.<New>
In other words, the way to
learn new Deathblow Skills
is through the frequent use
of various combinations of
the three basic attacks!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 30 w:58 h:5>
So, whatcha think?
Doesn't it just make ya want
to go out there now and start
learning those Deathblow
Skills as soon as possible!?<Close><Delay 20><Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 31 w:42 h:4>
Alright, here we go!<Delay 20>
More about Deathblows
and their relation to
experience levels...!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 32 w:54 h:5>
If you want to see how
close you are to learning
certain Deathblow Skills,
go to the Menu screen and
then to the Status screen.<New>
From the Status screen you
can select 'Skills' to view
a list of your Deathblows,
with meters showing the
percentage learned so far.<New>
If one of the meters
just doesn't seem to be
rising, then you're
probably using the attack
buttons in the wrong order.<New>
In that case, it might be
best to try a sequence
you normally haven't been
using. So experiment with
different attack patterns!<New>
But remember this...!
Some Deathblow Skills
cannot be obtained until
you have reached a certain
level of experience!<New>
If you have not attained
that experience level, then
it won't matter even if the
Deathblow's meter has
reached 100%...!<New>
In this case, you will have
to wait until your level of
experience increases before
you will be able to learn
that Deathblow!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 33 w:46 h:4>
...And that's about it.<Delay 20>
If you keep up in your
studies, you're bound
to go far!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 34 w:52 h:4>
Here you go...<Delay 20>
This is an allowance for
being such an enthusiastic
scholar!<Delay 20> Hah hah hah!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 35 w:26 h:1>
Received 80G!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 36 w:48 h:3>
Buy some pencils and
books with that, okay!?<Delay 20>
Stick with it, kid!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 37 w:52 h:4>
Oh well... You can never
be too old to study.<Delay 20> There
are mountains of things to
learn out there, young'un!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 38 w:28 h:4>
Don't tell me!<Delay 20>
It's about the
Memory Cube,
right?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 39 w:62 h:3>
Oh good, good!<Delay 20>
You're lucky, you came
just at the right time...<New>
If it's about the Memory Cube,
then don't hesitate to ask me.
No one knows better than I do!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 40 w:40 h:4>
How about it, then?
Want to hear me out?
<Opcode 1 255>    Yeah, okay!
    No, not really!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 41 w:40 h:4>
Alright! Good show!
That's the spirit!
You're pretty smart
for an artist.<New>
Now, open up those
ears and carve every
word I say into that
tiny brain of yours!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 42 w:54 h:6>
I'll begin by explaining
how to save your adventure.<New>
Normally, you can open up
the Menu screen by pressing
the <S> button.<Delay 20> From there
you can select the 'File'
option, and simply follow
the directions to save.<New>
However, when you are in a
town or a dungeon, you can
only save at designated
Memory Cube areas.<Delay 20> Without
a Cube you cannot save!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 43 w:64 h:13>
<Opcode 1 255>To make a long story short...
This bobbing, spinning thing is
a 'Memory Cube', right!? You
must be cool, calm and collected
to superimpose yourself upon it
and boldly open the Menu screen.
If you accomplish that you will
be able to save successfully.
You should always save without
hesitation whenever you find
one of these in the dungeon.
In life, you can never tell
what may lie around the corner!<Opcode 2 140><Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 44 w:50 h:4>
So, what do you think?
You understood everything
perfectly, then!?<Delay 20>
Okay, well I gotta...<New>
Wha?
You didn't understand?<Delay 20>
Aww gee...<Delay 20> Well alright,
let me explain once more!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 45 w:54 h:6>
Alright, this time, make
sure you're listening then!<Delay 20>
This spinning and bobbing
thing here is the 'Memory
Cube' I just spoke about.<New>
Fearlessly stand inside of
the Cube's area then calmly
and composedly open up the
Menu screen! From there you
will be able to save into a
memory file as per usual.<New>
Especially in dungeons and
similar areas, as soon
as you see one of these
you should save without
hesitation. You never can
tell what may happen next!<New>
When outside on the World
Map, you can save anywhere
you like (...probably)!
If you don't want to end
up crying later, make sure
you save frequently, okay!?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 46 w:50 h:4>
So, that's it for
my concise summary!<Delay 20>
You took it all in this
time, didn't you...?<New>
Well, even a 2-year-old
Dongarian monkey could
understand my fantastic
explanation 120%, right!?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 47 w:38 h:2>
Hooh-ho-ho!<Delay 20>
I'm such a genius!!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 48 w:52 h:4>
And now, about the
explanation fee...<New>
Ha-haa! Just kidding...<Delay 20>
You didn't think the great
Lucca would be that mean,
did you?<New>
This time I'll give you a
special deal and let you
have that one for free!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 49 w:50 h:2>
And you owe me 28G!
Don't forget that, okay!?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 50 w:56 h:4>
Alright, now for the
explanation fee...
It's 28G!<New>
28G is a bargain considering
you were able to receive
such a perfect explanation
from the likes of me!!!<New>
So c'mon, drop the excuses.
Be a man and pay up!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 51 w:46 h:1>
Had 28G taken from you!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 52 w:52 h:2>
Yes, thank you so much...<Delay 20>
No receipts given, though!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 53 w:56 h:2>
What the...!?
You don't even have 28G?<New>
I guess I have no choice...<Delay 20>
You'll have to owe me, then.<New>
Don't forget, you now owe
me 28G! You got that, Fei?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 54 w:28 h:1>
Owe Lucca 28G!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 55 w:54 h:5>
What!?<Delay 5>
You won't hear what I
have to say?
Don't you want to know!?<New>
The logical, comprehensible
and downright beautiful
lecture given by me,<Delay 5> the
one and only great Lucca,<Delay 5>
can only do you good...!<New>
...No matter how many
times you listen to it!<Delay 20>
Oh, what a waste!<Delay 20> Well...
don't come crying to me
when you run into trouble.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 56 w:54 h:5>
What!?<Delay 5>
You won't hear what I
have to say?
Don't you want to know!?<New>
The logical, comprehensible
and downright beautiful
lecture given by me,<Delay 5> the
one and only great Lucca,<Delay 5>
can only do you good...!<New>
...How will you ever know
unless you hear it out!?<Delay 20>
Oh, what a waste!<Delay 20> Well...
don't come crying to me
when you run into trouble.<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 57 w:54 h:4>
Oh, and you owe me 28G!<Delay 20>
You haven't forgotten
that have you, Fei?<New>
If you're trying to get out
of paying your debt, I'm
not going to let you off
that easily. You got that!?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 58 w:54 h:5>
Did you know that you can
spin the world around with
the L1 and R1 buttons!?<Delay 20>
I'm sure you'll see things
you weren't able to before!<New>
Explore the world by using
your own eyes and ears!<Delay 20>
That is how you make the
gains in your life truly
your own!<New>
If you're lost, then be
lost!<Delay 20> There is no need to
rush, is there?<Delay 20> Nor do you
have to explore the world
using someone else's maps!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 59 w:58 h:3>
I come here often to talk
to the village consultant.
He usually gives good advice.<New>
Although, once in a while
he can be a little absent-
minded...<New>
Just recently, he mixed up
the love potion with the
balding potion...<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 60 w:34 h:2>
Hehe...<Delay 20> Yes, sir!
Whatever you say!<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 61 w:48 h:2>
We'll have to continue
this conversation later!<Close><Close><End of Block>
