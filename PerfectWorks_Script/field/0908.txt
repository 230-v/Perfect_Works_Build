Av has been taken back
from Shakhan and Geburah.<New>
Thank you.<New>
Now, in order to free
other lands from
Geburah and Solaris,<New>
we must destroy the
remaining two Gates
and bring down Solaris.<New>
From deciphering Shakhan's
documents, apparently the
Gates are positioned at<New>
the three points of an
equilateral triangle."<Close><End of Block>

at one of those points.<New>
Two others are left, but
we only know where one of
those is, I guess?"<Close><End of Block>

the Ethos headquarters.<Delay 20>
However..."<Close><End of Block>

like that when we followed
Stone under the Church HQ.<New>
If it is there...<Delay 30>it must

Gears."<Close><End of Block>

dig a giant hole in

we would be doing it
already."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:20 h:2>

"...Oh..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:42 h:4>

ships don't have such
firepower."<Close><End of Block>

Bart
"A weapon with firepower

Yeah! That's it <--><Delay 10>
Fort Jasper! The gun on

What about that?"<Close><End of Block>

Bart
"What is
it, Citan?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 21 w:52 h:4>
Citan
"As strong as the Jasper's
firepower may be,<New>
how would we target the
Church HQ underground?<New>
To damage something that

have to attack it from
directly above.<New>
But the Jasper cannon
is..."<Close><End of Block>

"Indeed..."<Close><End of Block>

put Fort Jasper at the
top of Babel?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 24 w:50 h:4>

"Now that you mention it,
Babel's summit does over-
look Church headquarters.<New>
If we shoot from there,
it might just be possible
to get through to below
ground."<Close><End of Block>

Fort Jasper?"<Close><End of Block>

A giant mirror in an

There might just be
something to this..."<Close><End of Block>

I have solved

<TextBlock 38 w:50 h:4>
Citan
"Babel and Jasper...<Delay 10>
are both ruins from the
same civilization.<New>
One far more
scientifically
advanced than
our own...<New>
Do the two structures
not have a very
similar ambience?<New>
And both are built in
anticipation of some
powerful invading force,
or the use of Gears."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 39 w:44 h:3>
Fei
"Yeah, I noticed that.
But what does it all
mean?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 40 w:48 h:4>
Citan
"In short, it means the
people who built Babel's
giant mirror...<New>
knew about the giant
cannon at Jasper!"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 41 w:24 h:4>
Bart
"And...?<Delay 30>
What are you
getting at?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 42 w:46 h:4>
Citan
"We must assume that
the mirror was built to
reflect something...<New>
That something being a
beam. A beam shot from
the Jasper cannon!"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 43 w:48 h:4>
Fei
"Reflect?<Delay 30>
You mean that mirror can
reflect a beam attack?"<Close><End of Block>

Citan
"Yes."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 45 w:40 h:3>

"Are you saying
Babel and Jasper...<New>
were at war with one
another long ago?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 46 w:48 h:3>
Citan
"Oh <--><Delay 10> no.<New>
Rather, that the Babel
mirror and Jasper cannon
are two parts that make
up a single weapon."<Close><End of Block>

Rico
"Say what!?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 48 w:52 h:4>
Elly
"Come on...those things
are so far apart, how
could they be one weapon?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 49 w:46 h:3>
Citan
"Well, as spread
out as they are,<New>
do the Gate-generator
systems not also amount
to a single device?"<Close><End of Block>

Elly
"Yes, I see what
you mean, but..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 51 w:32 h:4>

would the weapon
be for?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 52 w:42 h:2>
Citan
"That I do not know."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 53 w:46 h:4>
Bart
"Whatever. The question
is how can we use the
two weapons as one?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 54 w:48 h:4>
Citan
"We fire a beam from the
Jasper cannon, aiming it
at the mirror.<New>
The mirror will reflect
the beam to strike the
Gate."<Close><End of Block>

work?"<Close><End of Block>

Citan
"Theoretically, it 
should be possible.<New>
Delicate adjustments
will be required..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 58 w:40 h:4>
Sigurd
"I imagine adjusting
the mirror will be
tricky."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 59 w:44 h:3>

"If the two are in
truth a single weapon,<New>
then it should not
be too difficult.<Delay 20>
I hope..."<Close><End of Block>

Rico
"But it's a dangerous
job.<New>
I wonder if it does
something like waits
for the enemy to fire<New>
and then reflects it
back at them.<New>
One false move and
it'll be ourselves
that get zapped."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 61 w:46 h:4>
Citan
"Yes. In that respect
the cannon part will
be difficult.<New>
The mirror must be hit
precisely."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 62 w:50 h:4>
Citan
"We will need to divide
into two teams.<New>
One will fire the beam
from the Jasper cannon.
The other will adjust the
angle of the mirror to<New>
ensure the beam scores a
direct hit on the Church
headquarters.<New>
Since this was my idea,
I will take the hazardous
part of adjusting the
mirror."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 63 w:36 h:4>
Sigurd
"Alright, Hyuga,
we'll let you take
care of that...<New>
It seems like your
kind of job."<Close><End of Block>

Doc might need help."<Close><End of Block>

the cannon?"<Close><End of Block>

Don't worry, I won't

"Then it's settled.<New>
Citan's party will aim
the Babel mirror at the

We'll aim the Jasper

Let's get back to the
