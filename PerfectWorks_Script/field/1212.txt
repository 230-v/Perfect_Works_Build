I doubt they were

Gate to be destroyed.<New>
So I'm sure they'll

We should plan carefully,

"And Sigurd and
I were stowaways.<New>
We did not have the
luxury of looking
out the window.<New>
On top of that,
as you exit the Gate
out of Solaris you
'jump' to some other<New>
place entirely <-->
an effect of crossing
the boundary between
two Gates.<New>
You may recall when
Kislev's Gatekeeper-
equipped vessel,<New>
the Goliath<Delay 5>...umm<Delay 5>...
'touched down' upon
this one.<New>
Similar to that, one
loses all sense of
where they had just
been."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 59 w:42 h:4>
Fei
"Even if it is split
off from other places
by the Gates,<New>
don't you at least
have a sense of the
surrounding terrain?<New>
Like is there a
mountain range,
or is it covered
by jungle?"<Close><End of Block>

"...I don't<Delay 10> think there
were mountains.<New>
It was more like the

So doesn't that rule
out the north?<New>
That way's the pole,
right?<Delay 10> It's snow that'd
be all around, never
mind the ocean."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 62 w:54 h:4>
Fei
"Then the Gate's location
has got to be in the south.<New>
In this triangle, there'd
be nothing but ocean at the
center.<Delay 10> That would fit with
what Elly just told us.<New>
Whereas, if the Gate was
positioned at the northern
point, then the center
would be over a continent."<Close><End of Block>

are right."<Close><End of Block>

If it is there, it could

So what's the problem?"<Close><End of Block>

It's a submarine,
not a bathyscaphe.<New>
It can't dive to those

water pressure would
crush us instantly."<Close><End of Block>
