An incident at Jugend
one year ago...<New>
Case 102, a release
of intrinsic powers<New>
due to administration of
overprescribed mental-
enhancement narcotics.<New>
Ether-response value
exceeded 400 at that time.<New>
Within seconds, two of
those involved were
critically wounded and
three required recycling.<New>
Correct?"<Close><End of Block>

Currently, the Solaris

working on genetic engin-

It's a nest for fools
who take pleasure in
inhumane deeds,<New>
manipulating organic

Nanotechnology."<Close><End of Block>

"Do you know what these
are?<Delay 10> Nanomachines <-->
molecular devices.<New>
This is one such
nanomachine, called
an assembler,<New>
which can break down
molecules and atoms
and reconstruct them,
creating matter freely.<New>
Each of these spheres
is the size of an atom.<New>
Until recently, I was
busy creating ones
several times this size.<New>
But thanks to the girl,
the legacy of the long-
lost Zeboim civilization,<New>
I'm now able to make them
as small and intricate
as this.<New>
This mechanism being
created over 4000 years
ago is quite astonishing.<New>
Up until we discovered
it, only unrefined work
was possible...<New>
At best, we would re-
constitute the bodies
of the injured using
the amino acids and<New>
so forth provided from
the outside world, or
'Limit' certain abilities,
that kind of thing.<New>
I imagine you learned
about human genetic
structure when you
were at Jugend.<New>
About how the various
enzymes in our genes are,
in a manner of speaking,<New>
also molecular machines,
created by nature.<New>

form is indeed of natural
origin..."<Close><End of Block>

up until now, although I
could restructure genes,<New>
the greater depths were

machines have quite
easily found that
information.<New>
Information that, in
essence, 'should not
exist'.<New>
