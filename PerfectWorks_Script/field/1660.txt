to do with me...?"<Close><End of Block>

I see you have not
caught on yet...!<Close><End of Block>

Fei
"Doc!!<Delay 10> What are
you doing here!?"<Close><End of Block>

Citan
"I saw the
fleet review,<New>
and the images of
the young one and
the others being
held captive,<New>
via Birdvision on
Level 3 Block E."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:48 h:2>
Fei
"You saw that too, Doc?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 6 w:46 h:4>
Citan
"Yes.<Delay 10> But there was
no sign of either
of you there.<New>
Soon after, I heard
about a disturbance <-->
intruders in Level 2's
Araboth Plaza.<New>
I suspected that
was probably you,
so I waited here.<New>
There was no news
after that about the
intruders having
been captured."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:38 h:3>
Fei
"How did you know I
would come here?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:50 h:4>
Citan
"To sneak into the
sacred palace,<New>
entering through the
underground trash chute
on Level 3 would be best.<New>
And to get back to
Level 3, you would have
to pass through this
observation tower.<New>
At any rate...I know I
say this every time, but<Delay 10>
do you think you could
be a little more subtle?<New>
When infiltrating enemy
territory, stealth is
fundamental.<New>
Honestly, if you make
this much of a scene
you will wake the dead."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:46 h:3>

"Well, I was actually
trying to be subtle..."<Close><End of Block>

"By the way, what
happened to Elly?<Delay 10>
She is not with you?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 11 w:44 h:4>
Fei
"Elly has...<Delay 10>
returned to her home.<New>
She really shouldn't
associate with we land
dwellers.<Delay 10> She has such
wonderful parents..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:42 h:4>
Citan
"I see...<Delay 10>
Yes. Maybe that would
be better for her.<New>
Well then, let us
make haste and head
for the trash chute."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:10 h:1>
Yeah!<Opcode 2 30><Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 14 w:44 h:3>
Citan
"Now Fei,<Delay 10> stick close
to me.<Delay 10> That way you
will not be detected."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 15 w:4 h:1>
?<Delay 5>?<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 16 w:46 h:4>
Fei
"Wait a minute, Doc.<Delay 10>
How come you can get
past here?<New>
According to Elly, only
First Class citizens
and military personnel
can pass through..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 17 w:54 h:3>
Citan
"Huh!?<Delay 20> Um<Delay 10>...<Delay 10>well...<New>
Th-<Delay 10>They probably have not
deleted my ID from the days
I was in the military,<New>
so it is still stored
in the administration
center's data bank."<Close><End of Block>

careless in Solaris
