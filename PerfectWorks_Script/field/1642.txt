"It is by the will of His
Majesty that the Gates we
control were taken down.<New>
But there are
foolish beasts<New>
who have taken the
opportunity to defile
this holy land with
their unclean feet.<New>
Using the confusion of
the dispelled Gates to
their advantage,<New>
those beasts were
prowling around beneath
the throne of our great
Emperor himself!!<New>
This is a situation most
grave and improper.<Delay 10> The
divine throne, defiled!<New>
But have no fear.<New>
Those bold yet foolish
miscreants have been
apprehended and are in
shackles as we speak!"<Close><End of Block>

<Opcode 14 1>    My beloved children, you
    can be at ease. Dispelling
    the Gates on the surface
    was planned in advance by
    the Gazel Ministry and I.
    We Gazel, the ones chosen
    by God <Delay 10><--> sleeping Mother
    God...<Delay 10> The hour approaches
    when we will return to
    God's paradise, and be
    granted immortal life.<New>
    Therefore, we have opened
    the door to Machanon...
    the land where God sleeps,
    the source of wisdom and
    power. The surface dwellers
    will no doubt take advantage
    of this, banding together
    and seeking to take that
    power into their own hands.<New>
    But there is no need
    to worry...
    Not as long as we have this
    might in Solaris...<Close><End of Block>
