Fei
"Do you still intend to
kill me? Then go right
ahead.<New>
But you'd better not do it
while we're in this forest.
Forest monsters hate loud
noises, you know..."<Close><End of Block>

"Fine.
Don't talk to me if
you don't want to.<New>
But would it kill you

tending to your
wounds?"<Close><End of Block>

B-But you shouldn't

Don't think you have

so afraid of?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:52 h:4>
Mysterious Woman
"I-I'm not afraid.
I'm just being cautious.<New>
It's natural considering 
that I've met such a 
suspicious Lamb."<Close><End of Block>

"Don't you worry.
I'm not gonna do anything.<New>
Besides, you're much more
suspicious than I am."<Close><End of Block>

Fei
"What's with you and
this 'Lamb' thing?<New>
We're both lost in this
forest, surrounded by
dangerous monsters...<New>
Shouldn't we at least
be cooperating with
each other until we
get out of here?"<Close><End of Block>

"Good.<Delay 20>
So what's your name?<New>
It's going to be hard for
us to cooperate without
at least knowing each
other's names.<New>
My name is Fei Fong Wong.<Delay 100>
You can call me Fei."<Close><End of Block>

"Anyway, it's too dangerous
to travel in these parts
this late at night...<New>
Let's wait till daybreak
before we continue looking
for a way out of here...<Delay 20>
If that's okay with you?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 24 w:36 h:4>
Elly

no choice, do we?
Very well."<Close><End of Block>

something to eat?"<Close><Close><End of Block>
