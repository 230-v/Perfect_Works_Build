<TextBlock 23 w:46 h:4>
Elly
"Come to think of it,<New>
it feels like we
deliberately took
a roundabout way
of getting here.<New>
There must've been a
faster way to get to
Bart and the others.<New>
Also, the route to get
to this section doesn't
even appear on the map
we downloaded.<New>
I wonder how he knows
the exact way despite
that."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 24 w:44 h:4>

"That's impossible.<New>
First of all, the
bulkhead we passed
through to get into
this section <--><New>
its panel showed that
this is a P4 facility.<New>
Even senior officers
of Solaris can't just
walk on through that.<New>

thing would be left
unlocked and open?"<Close><End of Block>

"There's simply no way!<New>
To luckily sneak into
Solaris while its on

infiltrate the palace

more luckily still open
a P4-level door,<New>
and even know the purpose
of the facility...<Delay 30>
How is that possible?"<Close><End of Block>

didn't know the truth

you know?<New>

Emperor Cain and the

"Of course, that goes
for the Emperor alone.<New>
For he is a human fated
to be unable to die.<New>
But the fate of the Gazel
was different.<New>
Due to the war with the
former surface dwellers...<Delay 20>
or, rather, because of
the Diabolos invasion,<New>
the elders of the Gazel
lost their fleshly bodies
altogether.<New>
Now the Solaris-governing
Gazel Ministry exist in
memory banks,<New>
their respective
personalities nothing
more than data."<Close><End of Block>

"After the Day of Collapse,
insisting on corporeality,
they desired resurrection<New>

the Soylent Systems that

here to Etemenanki<New>
as a research facility to
produce suitable bodies.<New>
Before long, no longer
limited to researching
only the Emperor's
longevity treatments<New>

bodily resurrection,<New>
it came to double as a
facility researching
biological weapons,<New>

additives for controlling
the will of the people.<New>
Even the Memory Cubes,
which you all use
quite innocently <--><New>
they are devices that were
