The Emperor, who reigns

Gazel Ministry.<Close><End of Block>

Citan
"Naturally, that was 
only one person, the 
Emperor. He is a human 
whose destiny is to 
never die.<New>
But the Gazel's destiny 
was different.<New>
Due to the war with 
the former 
surface-dwellers... 
or, rather, because of 
the Diabolos' invasion,<Delay 30>
the old men of Gazel lost 
their bodies altogether.<New>
Now the Solaris-governing 
Gazel Ministry exists 
on memory banks,<New>

personalities mere data."<Close><End of Block>

"After the Day of Collapse, 
they became fixated upon 
their corporeality. 
Desiring resurrection,<New>
they transferred one of 
the Soylent Systems from 
the surface to Etemenanki 
so that it might produce 
suitable bodies.<New>
Eventually the institution, 
no longer limited to 
researching only the 
Emperor's longevity 
treatments and Ministry's 
corporeal resurrection,<New>
came to double as a 
facility researching 
organic weapons, 
along with special food 
and drug additives that 
would regulate public 
opinion.<New>
The memory cubes, 
too, which Fei and the 
others used without concern
they are devices that were 
installed to collect 
surface-dwellers' 
bio-data.<New>
Of course, various data was 
also sent by the 'Church 
of the Ethos' to help."<Close><End of Block>
