Why!?<Delay 20>
Why did the villagers

I was just trying to save

I never intended to destroy

Even if that were

I sent those Gears into

A catalyst was needed

Grahf
"That's right.<Delay 10> The demise
of your loved ones...<New>
And you, helpless to
prevent it...<Delay 10> The grief,<Delay 10>
the scream from your heart
born out of the tragedy...<New>
THAT was the trigger for
your power."<Close><End of Block>

Grahf
"Who cares why!?
It does not matter how
many of them died...<New>
They were wretched vermin,
only living from day to day

their prescribed destinies!<New>
And have you forgotten?<Delay 10>
You were the one who
destroyed the village.<Delay 10>
I did not lift a finger."<Close><End of Block>

Surely you have heard it?<New>
It is the very essence of

a most delightful scream.
I was enthralled by it.<New>
Nothing is more beautiful

"Hmph, do you really wish
to know?<New>
But for you to learn
that at this point would
be a waste."<Close><End of Block>

is not yet fit for
purpose.<New>
It is only reasonable

until it becomes so."<Close><End of Block>

Grahf
"What will you do, Fei?
If you fall here, then
that's it.<New>
Perhaps, for you,
ignorance would be bliss.
But is that what you truly
desire...?<New>
If what you really want is
to know the truth...<New>
Then you must show me that
you have attained the level
of strength I require...<New>
To do that you must destroy
others using your own
power!<New>
Only then, in exchange for
a scream of death, will you
regain all that was lost!!<Delay 15>
Hahahaha!!"<Close><End of Block>
