Citan
"Your Rankar opponent was
quite something.<New>
No ordinary Gear could
defeat such a monster.
Keeping yourself in good
shape has paid off..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 4 w:36 h:3>
Fei
"Why did you bring
this here, Doc?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 5 w:36 h:3>
Citan
"This...?
You mean <Weltall>?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 6 w:44 h:4>
Fei
"...<Weltall>?
This is the Gear that
destroyed Lahan.<New>
Why bring this, of all
things, when I never
wanted to see a Gear
ever again...?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 7 w:38 h:4>
Citan
"I understand how
you feel.<New>
But to protect our-
selves, to survive,
we need a certain
degree of strength.<New>
Even moreso for
those being pursued."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 8 w:52 h:4>
Fei
"I agree that some
strength is needed
for self-defense.<New>
And if it weren't for this
Gear here, Elly and I'd be
in that Rankar's stomach
right now.<New>
But its power goes beyond
what is necessary. Does
one really need the power
to destroy everything?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 9 w:10 h:2>
Citan
"..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:38 h:4>
Fei
"I don't need such
power. I still...
don't like Gears."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 11 w:54 h:4>
Citan
"Fei, using power or being
used by power is a trial of
the mind, for each of us...<New>
I believe that as long as
people do not misuse it,
power can be a good thing.
It can help us.<New>
In that respect, I know
you will be fine. Indeed,
You helped someone just
now. Did you not?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 12 w:48 h:4>
Fei
"I want to believe that.
But for some reason I
can't. This thing..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 13 w:34 h:4>
Fei
"Oh well.
At least Elly is
safe now."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 14 w:28 h:3>

have come to."<Close><End of Block>

"I..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 16 w:54 h:4>
Citan
"I am Citan, a friend of
Fei's. You were nearly that
Rankar's meal!<New>
If Fei had not intervened,
I hate to think what might
have happened.<New>
I am not too sure about his
rashness in trying to take
on that beast with just his
bare fists, though!"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 17 w:26 h:2>
Elly
"Bare fists?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 18 w:50 h:4>

it seems that this
did not go to waste..."<Close><End of Block>

Elly
"!!"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 20 w:50 h:4>

"Let us just say we are
borrowing what the Kislev
army left behind."<Close><End of Block>

"...Right."<Close><End of Block>

"Thank you, Fei.
That's twice now."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 23 w:36 h:4>

"Don't mention it.
I'll just put it
on your tab."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 24 w:50 h:4>
Citan
"It is getting dark.
Let us set up camp, and
start out early tomorrow.<New>
Both of you look tired

repairs on our friend
here."<Close><End of Block>

Are you alright?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 30 w:38 h:2>

<TextBlock 31 w:44 h:2>
Citan
"Oh, you were awake?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 32 w:42 h:4>
Fei
"Not the whole time.
But I heard you two
talking."<Close><End of Block>

"..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 34 w:46 h:3>
Fei
"So Elly is...
You already suspected?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 35 w:28 h:2>
Citan
"Fei, she..."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 36 w:50 h:4>
Fei
"I know. Elly's not to
blame for anything.<New>
What happened to the
village is my fault.
I dumped all my feelings
on Elly...<New>
I'm the one who should
apologize."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 37 w:46 h:4>
Citan
"Fei, do not blame
yourself. It was not
your fault, either.<New>
You were just trying to
protect the village."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 38 w:54 h:4>
Fei
"Thanks, Doc...
By the way, how is everyone
from the village doing?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 39 w:50 h:4>
Citan
"Do not worry, Yui will
take care of them.<New>
I told her to leave soon
and take them all to...
a certain place.<New>
They should be safe for
the time being. Just
focus on your own
situation now."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 40 w:24 h:2>
Fei
"Okay, Doc."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 41 w:54 h:4>
Citan
"So, what do we do next?<New>
First of all, how about we
leave this forest and head
for the desert town of
Dazil?<New>
We may learn something
about what Av and Kislev
are up to and be able to
source parts for <Weltall>.<New>
At any rate, I doubt the Av
homeland will let the other
night's fiasco go
unanswered for long."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 42 w:36 h:2>
Fei
"What is that...?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 43 w:42 h:4>
Citan
"That...would appear
to be an aerial
battleship from Av."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 44 w:54 h:4>
Fei
"An aerial battleship?
I've never heard of Av
having anything like that."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 45 w:44 h:4>
Citan
"Of course, Av itself
is not armed with such
things.<New>
Most likely it belongs
to Geburah, who are
stationed there."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 46 w:20 h:2>
Fei
"Geburah?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 47 w:48 h:4>
Citan
"The Sacred Empire of
Solaris' Special Forces,
known as 'Geburah'.<New>
I am sure you have heard
something about them?<New>
They are a group
providing large-scale
military aid to the
Kingdom of Av.<New>
They showed up in Ignas
eleven years ago.
Up until then, Av had
been losing to Kislev.<New>
But with Geburah's help
they have managed to
even the odds.<New>
They are now expanding
their territory and
gathering resources
buried in the ruins."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 48 w:50 h:4>
Fei
"I've heard the village
elders talk about it...
Wait, could Elly be...!?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 49 w:52 h:4>
Citan
"Quite possibly so.
Their group has superior
technology and power.<New>
It is rumored they are
here solely to get the
resources in the ruins.<New>
To think they would bring
in such a large ship...
It must be to suppress the
recent border skirmishes."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 50 w:42 h:3>
Fei
"So they are fighting
the Kislev Empire?"<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 51 w:48 h:4>
Citan
"Yes. It seems there are
newly-found ruins on the
northern edge of Av.<New>
Those ruins are under a
500-year-old temple.<New>
Three weeks ago, Kislev
seized those ruins.
Most likely they are
fighting over that."<Close><Close><End of Block>
