"I<Delay 5>...<Delay 10> I'm sorry about
what just happened<Delay 5>...<Delay 10>
Forgive me...<New>
But<Delay 5> I want to explain.<New>
Now,<Delay 10> for the first time,<Delay 10>
be they surface dweller
or Solarian, the people's
hearts have been united.<New>
And yet,<Delay 10> not everyone is
strong like the crew of
this ship, or the people
of Shevat.<New>
If even we have been on the
brink of losing sight of
the future,<Delay 10> what must it
be like for regular people?<New>
That's why the people need
someone like you to turn
to,<Delay 10> a ray of light.<New>
The hearts of those who
had merely been used as
tools of the Ministry for
hundreds of years...<New>
The one who freed them
from that spell was
you, Elly.<New>
Your safety is no longer
just your own concern.<Delay 10>
You cannot be put in
danger.<New>
I don't want to have
you fight anymore."<Close><End of Block>

Elly
"In the beginning,<Delay 10>
I think I had projected
myself onto you.<New>
Superimposed myself over
you,<Delay 10> as you were in a
similar situation to me.<New>
It was only when I was
with you that I didn't
feel loneliness, or
anxiety.<New>
That's why I'd thought...
I must like you.<Delay 10>
But that wasn't it.<New>
I just didn't have the
courage to look at my
true self.<New>
I had simply been
escaping into you.<Delay 10>
I had mistaken that
for love."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 10 w:54 h:4>
Elly
"But<Delay 10> it's different now.<Delay 10>
I can confront my own
situation head-on.<New>
I am me<Delay 5>...and you are you.<Delay 10>
I see that clearly.<New>
And I've rediscovered
that I do need you.<New>
I don't need you because I
want to be released from
my worries.<Delay 10> I need you
because I love you."<Close><End of Block>

I know that you're

I have a bad feeling...<Delay 10>

Elly
"No, no...<Delay 5>it's not that.<Delay 10>
It's something very
different<Delay 5>...<New>
Like I'm being torn
apart by something
uncontrollable,<Delay 10> and
I'm no longer me<Delay 5>...<New>
Even though you'll be
coming back,<Delay 10> it's still<Delay 5>...<Delay 10>
It's unbearably
unsettling<Delay 5>...<New>
That's why I want to go
with you.<Delay 10> I don't want
to be apart from you
for even a moment."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 15 w:50 h:4>
Fei
"It's the same for me.<Delay 10>
I've felt it ever since I
met you in the forest<Delay 5>...<New>
I think it's maybe the
same thing that you'd
been feeling.<New>
I was escaping into you,
too.<New>
But I have to solve my
problems on my own.<Delay 10>
I can't let them be
a burden to you."<Close><End of Block>

Unstable as I am, it's
thanks to you that I can
be as you see me now.<New>
Because you're always
by my side, I can hold
on to my own self."<Close><End of Block>

So...<Delay 5> I...<New>
Elly,<Delay 10> I want you to be the
reason for me to come back
no matter what,<Delay 10> the home
I must return to...<New>
If you're waiting for my
return, watching over
me even though we're in
