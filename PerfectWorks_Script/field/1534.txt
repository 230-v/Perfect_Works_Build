Maria's father, Professor
Nikola, was captured by
Solaris and nothing has
been heard from him since.<New>
In any case, I'm sure he's
being forced to do research
on Gears...<New>
If they develop 
<Seibzehn> further into
a new Gear weapon, and start
mass-producing them...<New>
Well, to say the least,
it would be more than we
could ever handle...<Close><End of Block>

Balthasar brought Maria
to Shevat about five
years ago,<Delay 20> along with
that <Seibzehn>.<New>
Balthasar said he sneaked
into Solaris by himself
and tried to save
Professor Nikola and
Maria.<New>
He laughed as he told
me that he managed to
escape with Maria and took
that <Seibzehn> as a
souvenir.<Close><Close><End of Block>
