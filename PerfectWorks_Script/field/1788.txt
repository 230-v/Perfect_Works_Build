So you listen if

Bart
"Okay?<Delay 20> Now listen up!<New>
The Limiters that are
coded into our bodies <--><New>
right now, the research
facility here is the only
place where we can get
them undone!<New>
Citan misled Karellen and
the other guys and brought
us here to do the Limiter-
reversal treatment!"<Close><End of Block>

You did make sure to

let's get out of here!"<Close><End of Block>

Bart isn't lying <-->
Citan is the one

Billy
"No Limiter?<Delay 10>
Isn't that because
Elly is a Solarian?"<Close><End of Block>

If we are delayed here,
it will get dangerous for

"Citan, we'll go to
Karellen's private
laboratory as planned.<New>
Let's rendezvous
afterward at the
place we agreed."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 33 w:48 h:4>
Citan
"That is not the only
reason I brought you
all here.<New>
Those who would strive
for independence from
Solaris must know the
country's situation,<New>
know its true form.<Delay 10>
Who it is that is
trying to do this,
plotting that, and why."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 34 w:52 h:4>
Citan
"Ostensibly, on the secret
orders of the Emperor,<New>
I was to make contact
with those who possessed
the fleshly bodies
wanted by the Ministry,<New>
transfer the data, and
if possible bring those
bodies back.<Delay 10> That is the
duty I had been assigned.<New>
As a consequence, I had
no choice but to keep up
the appearance that I
was deceiving you all.<New>
Please forgive me."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 35 w:38 h:4>
Citan
"Moreover, I needed
to use the facility
here, myself...<New>
There was something
I had to confirm
at all costs."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 36 w:42 h:2>
Citan
"I will tell you that
once we have safely
escaped from here.<New>
For it is something
you need to know."<Close><End of Block>

"...Hm?<Delay 32>
Y-Yes...<Delay 32>I did...<Delay 32>
Of course..."<Close><End of Block>

"Elly was taken to
Karellen's research lab.<New>
I was not in a position
to be able to stop that.
I am sorry."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 39 w:48 h:4>
Citan
"I do not know...<Delay 20>
But one thing
bothers me...<New>
When Karellen took
Elly, I had a chance
to acquire her bio-data.<New>
I analyzed it and
found something very
interesting...<Delay 10>
Or, rather...unusual.<New>
There is no Limiter
coded in her."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 40 w:48 h:4>
Citan
"Even Solarians are
born with Limiters
written in.<New>
In special cases <-->
particular people only,
such as Ramsus and I <--><New>
the Limiters are undone
much later, via the same
treatment I administered
to Bart and the others.<New>
But permission from the
Ministry is required for
that."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 41 w:44 h:3>
Citan
"There must be more
to it than that.<New>
The reason is unclear,
but Karellen is quite
fixated on her data."<Close><End of Block>

Citan
"I still have something
left to do.<Delay 10> I will destroy
the last of the Gates."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 43 w:52 h:4>
Citan
"Oh!<Delay 10> I meant to
tell you, young one <--><New>
the effects of the Limiter
reversal will not be so
readily apparent.<New>
The physical Limiters
you all have were
already naturally
quite ineffective.<New>
What I have counteracted
is the mental side of
things <--><New>
that is, the unconscious
fear of the Ministry and
the Emperor, the reverence
for them.<New>
Basically, you can now
battle against them
without restraint.<New>
It is not that you have
suddenly become more
powerful."<Close><End of Block>
<TextBlock 44 w:48 h:4>
Citan
"...Yes.<Delay 20> Something
Yui handed to me as
we were setting off.<New>
I had used it before
I met her.<New>
Since it is a technique
that takes lives, I have
kept it to myself for
a long time.<New>
But we have reached the
point where we cannot
just 'talk the talk',
have we not"<Close><End of Block>
