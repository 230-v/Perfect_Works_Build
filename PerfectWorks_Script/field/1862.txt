"There are things that
the weak, and only the
weak, can see...<New>
Just because they're
weak, that doesn't make

that they're able to foster
kindness...<New>
It's because they're weak
that there's a genuine
human connection you could
never see from on high.<New>
Everyone has a weak side.
Was it not so for all of
you at first, too?<New>
It's because you were weak
that you sought one another
out... And then tried to
grow strong...<New>
Don't forget those early
feelings... When you lived
together side by side..."<Close><End of Block>
