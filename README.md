## Introduction:

Xenogears: Perfect Works is a collaborative project aiming to make Xenogears a more complete experience. This does contain unmarked but mild spoilers, so readers are advised and warned not to scroll through this if they’re looking to use this mod to enjoy the game for the first time, or you simply never got to into it for various reasons we hope to address. These spoilers are primarily for certain story events in the story bits and lines are relegated to story specific changes and certain boss fights dungeons and all moves party members and availability are mentioned in the gameplay focused changes. 

~ Ryan (↙ ➡ ↘ ⬇ ↙ ⬅ ↘) Piccuito, character writer and handler for game balance on the Xenogears Perfect Works mod.

DISCLAIMER: Some of the patches were designed to work in tandem with each other. The exp/gold patch was designed to work with the lower encounter rate patch. The monster stats, character stats and items patches all act as a rebalancing hack. They can be used separately from each other, but they were designed with the mindset of using them together.

## FAQ:

Q) What is this? 

A) This is a romhack of Xenogears which aims to offer a number of optional patches to improve the game in a number of ways. You will download a patcher which can apply your choice of changes to the game, from a list of Quality of Life options, Rebalancing, Retranslation, and more.

Q) This will be my first time playing Xenogears. Should I use this hack? 

A) We are obviously a bit biased, but yes. Even if you're seeking a Xenogears experience that is true to the original, this project offers a number of optional patches, meaning you can apply as many or as few changes as you'd like to tailor the experence to your preferences. 

Q) If I started playing with an unpatched rom, can I patch my game, but keep my Save File?

A) Yup! The only place it could reasonably cause some issues would be with the party rebalance patch, but even then, it's fully playable. 

Q) What emulator should I use?

A) As long as you regenerate your game after patching, it should run fine on most emulators. That said, we recommend Duckstation.

Q) Does this project restore any of the cut content from Disc 2?

A) No. Sadly, it's impossible to implement this cut content with the hardware and knowledge limitations. The goal of this project is to make the Xenogears we got the best version of itself it can be.

Q) Can I use texture replacement with this?

A) Yes! Since this is a direct modification of the gamefile, while the texture replacements are run through emulator, they don't interfere with one another. We recommend checking out Lyn's texture mod, which you can find [here](https://godsibb.net/index.php?threads/xenogears-perfect-art-works-paw-retroarch-texture-pack.414/).

Q) Is the Perfect Works Build compatible with the undub patch?

A) Unfortunately no. This is due to differences with the file table in the undub patch which is difficult for xenoiso to interpret.

Q) Can the Japanese control scheme patch be used with the Perfect Works Build?

A) Yes it can.

Q) Are any of the patches mandatory?

A) No. You can pick what patches you wish to apply via the patcher. 

Q) Where should I download the Xenogears: Perfect Works Build?

A) Use the MEGA and Google Drive uploads provided at the top of the README.

Q) The patcher displays an error stating that a directory cannot be found.

A) Make sure the patcher is in the same directory as gamefiles, patches, xdelta and xenoiso.

Q) Is the Perfect Works Build compatible with the No Battle Flashes patch?

A) Unfortunately, it is not, though there are plans to add a battle flashes option.

Q) Can the patch be played on real PlayStation hardware?

A) Yes. The patch is routinely tested on PS1, PS2, PS3, PSP and PS Vita, and provided you have patched a clean rom, there should be no compatibility issues.

Q) Can the patch be played on real PlayStation hardware?

A) Yes. The patch is routinely tested on PS1, PS2, PS3, PSP and PS Vita, and provided you have patched a clean rom, there should be no compatibility issues.

Q) When I press patch, an empty command prompt briefly shown up, and the file sizes for the ROMs are only 0-1 KB.

A) This is most likely a result of using the patcher inside OneDrive. Two ways to go about this are to move the patcher and its associated files to a directory outside of OneDrive, or pause file synching when patching.

Q) When I press patch, the patcher crashes entirely.

A) This is most likely a result of using the patcher inside the Public directory. Move the patcher and any Xenogears ROMs to another location.

Regardless of whether the portrait mod has been selected, character facesets that previous suffered from rogue pixels have been fixed. The edited portraits are listed along with the filenames necessary to update them with emulators that support texture replacement:
