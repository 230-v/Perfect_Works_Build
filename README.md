## Introduction:

Hello. My name is Ryan (↙ ➡ ↘ ⬇ ↙ ⬅ ↘) Piccuito. I am a character writer and handler for game balance on the Xenogears Perfect Works mod. Xenogears: Perfect Works is a collaborative project aiming to make Xenogears a more complete experience. This does contain unmarked but mild spoilers, so readers are advised and warned not to scroll through this if they’re looking to use this mod to enjoy the game for the first time, or you simply never got to into it for various reasons we hope to address. These spoilers are primarily for certain story events in the story bits and lines are relegated to story specific changes and certain boss fights dungeons and all moves party members and availability are mentioned in the gameplay focused changes. 

DISCLAIMER: Some of the patches were designed to work in tandem with each other. The exp/gold patch was designed to work with the lower encounter rate patch. The monster stats, character stats and items patches all act as a rebalancing hack. They can be used separately from each other, but they were designed with the mindset of using them together.

The project is also largely incompatible with both Undub and Xenogears 2.0.

## Patches:

### [Battle Arena](https://github.com/NoharOSP/Perfect_Works_Build/wiki/Battling-Arena)

### Encounters:

- Encounter rate has been halved except for the Duneman Isle, Shevat Emergency Shaft, Anima Dungeon 2 and Deus for grinding reasons.

Throughout the game, encounter rates have been lowered. For many players, this has been a strikingly annoying part of the game. Especially for sections with platforming as in emulated versions of Xenogears players no longer can hear the disc rev up loading the battle. Because the jump input gets eaten when a battle is being loaded, this will have you run off cliffs which is very frustrating. So the encounter rate was halved across a majority of the game. Select areas such as Deus, Anima Dungeon 2, the Duneman Isles, and the Shevat Emergency Shaft were kept the same. Deus is a common experience grinding spot due to the Power Seraph giving the most exp out of any single enemy in the game. Shevat’s Emergency Shaft and Anima Dungeon 2 were good places to grind for deathblows and money, respectively. And the Duneman Isles is supposed to be a gauntlet with the constant threat of dragons (which also have exclusive end game equipment on them). Not only would dropping the encounter rate here defeat the point of the optional dungeon, it’d be a lot harder to get exclusive weapons.

### Exp/gold:

- All exp/gold rates have been increased by 50%.

As a way of compensating for lower encounter rates, money and experience have been increased by 50% in this patch to keep the game from spiking in difficulty.


### Fast text:

old_script is for versions of the ROM where the script patch hasn't been applied. new_script is for versions of the ROM where the script patch has been applied. Both versions contain modified versions of specific scenes where the text scrolls too quickly.

Scenes with which had the potential to crash the game with FFMaster's version of the patch if you mashed through them have had delay codes added to avoid this from happening.

#### Changed scenes:

- Elly crash landing in Lahan.
- Ramsus' introduction.
- Shakhan's speech before the tournament.
- The UFO story in the Orphanage.
- The Ethos data banks.
- Revelation about Bishop Stone.
- Bart's monologue about Ft Jasper when it is first used.
- Wave Existence scene.
